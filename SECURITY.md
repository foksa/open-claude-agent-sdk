# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/foksa/open-claude-agent-sdk/security/advisories/new) to report it confidentially.

For non-sensitive issues (e.g. dependency updates), you can open a regular [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/foksa/open-claude-agent-sdk/issues).

## Scope

This SDK is a thin wrapper around the Claude CLI. Security issues in the CLI itself should be reported to [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/security).
